            "generated": "Dream: Falling\nInterpretation: To dream that you are falling represents feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. You feel trapped in a life where nothing is happening or even expected of you. If the fall does not occur immediately, then it suggests your need to retreat from something important at hand. Alternatively someone will take over after you if there is no one left standing for you. Thus you may be unable\u00a0 to escape into another situation as soon \"falling\" enough. Consider also whether any fallen figures were wearing their own clothes when they crashed down on the building itself. It symbolizes repressed anger which was stored inside suppressed desires instead of confronting them head-on. The figure would look like an animal being chased by its owner who has lost his temper but still wants him back! Dreamings about this person indicate some hidden power within yourself that cannot be easily expressed through others. There is always more going around than what needs keeping. Such dreams represent aspects of yourself known beyond your waking experience and realities outside of your control. In particular, dreaming about seeing these people depicted with red balloons indicates those whom society views as overly protective/attractive traits. Things can get out of hand fast without warning. REM Asleep On Self Also Known as Dreams Abundance Sometimes referred literally simply as sleep paralysis ,dreams often come true because failure means death . People try to keep up appearances despite reality's flaws. Or else how could such things happen? Perhaps fear abounds regarding certain circumstances; perhaps everything changes forever before anybody hears again What Are They Up To For Something ? Often times we see images of past achievements presented in our subconscious mind along with ideas passed onto us via memories. These associations carry emotional significance especially toward youth and inexperience. _______________________________________________________________________________ **The Meaning Of A Fall Leaves Your Head Cripplingly Implications Since many children grow accustomed only to playing music videos due diligence, lessons learned and advice given in real life do not necessarily mean anything drastic nor lasting consequences unless accomplished. We tend towards higher goals set forth above all else. However, success depends upon patience, determination, persistence and perseverances. Don't let setbacks put you off guard - succeed *or fail miserably*. Note This phrase refers merely once in awhile to misfortune or loss. Being swept away underfoot signifies immaturity, inferiority, shortcoming and lack of self esteem. Ignoring adversity makes sense too much while ignoring obstacles make easy work harder.

Alternatively, it symbolizes your sexuality or desire for sex. If you wear makeup on a regular basis, then this may indicate an aspect of yourself which is unacceptably sexual.

You feel confident in where you are headed, but not afraid of the consequences if things go wrong. The dreams may be a metaphor for someone who is \"flying\" or just hanging around\", especially when they have crashed into something important. Consider also what type of airplane these people were on; it depends on how well-behaved their friends/family members are at all times. Also consider which direction this person has been heading recently. If he looks up from his current position, then there is some indication that others see him as being above criticism. His attitude toward authority will determine whether success comes with reward or punishment. Alternatively...you need to learn to accept responsibility before going through any difficulties. Perhaps even worse, becoming overly arrogant\u00a0can lead one to self-destructive behavior instead OF happiness. In other words....a lot can happen soon enough!

            "generated": "Dream: Teeth falling out\nInterpretation: To see or dream that you have a leaking tooth indicates your desire to rid yourself of unwanted possessions. You are looking for reassurance and healing from the negative consequences of your behavior. Alternatively, it suggests that there is something in your body which needs cleaning up and cleansing away before someone else can take advantage thereof.\u00a0 The problem may be coming back on itself after some period has passed without any changes occurring. If this leaky piece seems like an old habit, then perhaps part of what kept its current condition alive was put into perspective by other aspects within the animal's psyche? In particular if you notice strange growths inside of teeth, then these need to be looked at with care as they relate directly to issues surrounding longevity, dieting habits etc., especially regarding sexual activity. Consider also how much water/waterlogged material such \"mouth\" parts cling to those areas where life normally would not allow them to go unless specifically directed toward specific items instead (). A more direct metaphor relates oral sex (especially anal), but refers only towards intercourse over eggs or sperm. It could mean having children who were born virgin even though their birth mother still had womb filled contents stored around her baby until adulthood. Perhaps expressing affection between two different people through kissing symbolizes feelings expressed via words alone. Thus one person cannot love another because of his own flaws. What does livingliness look like when viewed upside down? For example, putting together four walls signifies beauty while keeping everything solid underneath. Or ten feet above ground represents elegance; high points indicate prosperity. On earth, thorns represent fearlessness. Things stand no matter what others think or do.

You feel alienated from others or unable to rise above those around you.\u00a0Alternatively, death may be a symbol of rebirth . In particular if you wake up this morning with no memory of what happened on the day before, then it suggests that something has gone awry within yourself. Perhaps there is someone out to hurt you. If death happens at work or outside of your own home , then dreaming of being killed represents sadness about past disappointments and failures. The symbolism also depends on which side of the issue you were talking about earlier. Consider how life goes for any part of your character. Alternatively, losing an aspect of yourself means experiencing self-doubt. Something will happen again next time you regret doing so. It indicates unresolved issues where you have failed miserably. These qualities can manifest itself into violence as well as suffering when confronted with adversity. Some aspects might even erupt uncontrollablely inside you! A person who dies suddenly brings closure to these painful memories while allowing them to pass away without remorse.

The potential rewards for success depend on how well these items turn out! Consider also if any material has been rejected by one of the stores which may have inflated its value? Perhaps this item was given away instead of being needed . It could be analogous with \"taking\" drugs\". If someone else fails at an actual drug store but does not make much money selling them, then they were giving themselves too little credit where it due.

You may feel rejected and unwelcome in some situation. Consider the significance of what is pursuing you at this point in your life.\u00a0Consider also whether it symbolizes a \"fairytale\" adventure where someone ends up getting their way by refusing to follow through on important responsibilities. Alternatively, dreaming of being pursued implies sexual urges which will make others doubt themselves about who they really want with whom they live together. In particular if there is an actual person involved in taking advantage/dealing with these desires, then perhaps she has been manipulated into doing so via her own personal experiences. Perhaps such people need to be protected from harm caused by those around them.

It also represents frustration at being abandoned. The memory serves as motivation and inspiration.

A number of situations indicate deception/possession toward one another due directly to past misfortunes. People tend towards more honest thinking over less confrontational behavior instead preferring direct confrontation. Sometimes success comes only via self-confidence alone rather than cooperation. Try not being afraid to admit wrongdoing but refuse to back down unless necessary. Do not underestimate your own abilities Or perhaps fear exists beyond belief because circumstances dictate so much truth itself. Keep going At times I feel trapped trying desperately futilely impossible things without knowing anything positive happens next. These experiences sometimes serve to guide me along until finally nothing changes. Selfish goals always come first And dreams reveal secrets far bigger than words. Pay special attention lest certain goal do not pan out well enough For example, dreaming that eating fish means waking full circle surrounded by friends makes sense given its symbolism. Eating seafood signifies purity, fertility etc. Yet despite various appearances, doing good deeds represents luck, wealth or happiness. Asking permission could result literally transforming unwanted thoughts into real ones.
