            "generated": "Dream: Falling\nInterpretation: To dream that you are falling indicates an emotional breakdown or loss. You may be feeling overwhelmed and powerless in your current relationship or situation. Alternatively, the dreaming suggests that something is about to happen which will make it worse for you than what was originally planned. Consider also if a person has crashed into you on some sort of obstacle before experiencing this fallback state. It refers either to stress from past relationships or perhaps even death itself! If there is no breakneck speed going through the air at any point in your life, then it implies slow progress toward achieving goals. The goal might just not take off as quickly as expected.\u00a0Alternatively, falling represents fearlessness; failure means sadness and anxiety. Your subconscious desires to succeed depend almost exclusively upon how much luck can come out of your head when things go wrong. In particular rock climbing signifies success and longevity. On Earth, being down seems like punishment enough but nowhere near necessary. What do you think happened? Do you feel helplessness overcame you by refusing to quit doing certain activities/dreams instead ? Or does someone else have taken over all responsibility for losing control of your waking self? Perhaps feelings inside yourself indicate hopeless loneliness. Dreaming of dying causes guilt because everything around you failed you twice . People who know their own deaths often tend towards more remorseful thinking especially those directly responsible for them passing away while they were still alive. There is always hope after many hardships endured along the way. Keep up appearances Don't let others get ahead Pay attention to where people stand outside of work No matter how hard you try, sometimes circumstances don't see clearly onto you. Try not talking too fast \"I need to talk faster\" Give Yourself Up Sometimes dreams suggest that everyone gets so carried back emotionally with regretting one's actions that nothing changes until later. Things change forever More important Than anything Overall, these experiences highlight aspects we want to avoid making publically known (see above).

You feel ashamed about your sexuality or attitudes. Alternatively, the waking state of being is indicative of feelings of inadequacy, helplessness etc.\u00a0The dreams may also be an expression of embarrassment over something someone else has done to yourself . It signifies shamefulness which can lead into aggression toward others and even death within moments.

She repressed these negative thoughts so well that many still cling onto them today. Perhaps if people seen Marilyn Monroe dressed up differently than other female figures would appear less feminine looking once again. As children our parents often went shopping together after watching TV shows suchas Dancing Queen and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , but have always avoided actual physical contact due sometimes jealousy between mother and child. Maybe seeing Marilyn put forth new facade did bring additional charm qualities necessary to succeed in society.

You need to be more direct in some situation or move fast enough so that others will not notice. Alternatively, it represents the freedom and independence of a person who is currently on an airplane; perhaps there is something they don't want you know about. It also relates negatively toward someone else's achievements. Consider what kind \"flying\" means for additional significance when making these choices. If you feel unable get around at sea because of overbooking flights, then dreaming of being chased suggests potential danger lurking within yourself. Perhaps this may stem from feelings of helplessness inside or lack control of life's problems. The higher the risk level, therefore mean less responsibility/assurance levels lie ahead for those decisions which can lead prematurely to disaster. On another note , if the dreams sound too familiar, consider where their source of inspiration came from .\u00a0If no one was able see them clearly by sight, how did he come up with his ideas?

            "generated": "Dream: Teeth falling out\nInterpretation: To see or lick a rotting fetus in your dream symbolizes the womb. You may be feeling trapped and unable to move forward without some emotional conflict developing inside you. Alternatively, tears are symbolic of remorse; it is time for reflection.\u00a0Perhaps there is something that has hurt you more than others. If you have an unruly baby boy who looks like this, then perhaps he represents anger toward those around him. It also suggests aggression towards yourself which can lead inevitably into physical violence against someone else. Consider what type of bites were found on the pregnant man's genitals before waking up with his suspicions about child abuse. The dreams represent pain, suffering & death by various means . In particular , if you feel ripped off from any part during pregnancy, especially breasts, urine oozes onto the body where pleasure cannot flow freely until after birth. Dreams sometimes reveal secrets so being torn apart will leave no one but repressed memories behind. Some fear abortion could result in unwanted pregnancies because they did not want to give their children away as promised. Asking people at work how many times per week these women went through abortions indicates self-doubt regarding sex life. Perhaps all too often these mothers felt betrayed beyond belief. There is still much unresolved feelings within themselves related sexual activity occurring outside of marriage and family relationships. These thoughts tend unconsciously to escape my attention even though I know them well enough to recognize aspects of them. Pay close attention now to maternal symbolism surrounding words such \"sister\" and \"$\". On closer inspection, motherhood refers directly (or indirectly)to sexuality, fertility etc., depending upon your own personal associations with certain plants or animal companions. Thus meanings given herein imply love, affection/conception, sacrifice, protection, loyalty, cooperation, authority, mercy, friendship, purity - whatever name you choose to call her. *Please Note: Dream Meaning Implications Are Also Causing A Tiredness Or Painful Depression Feelings Your Self Is Being Delayed By More Than 4 Hours Since Feces Merely Sake Curdling And Screaming ______________________________________________________________ **Mealer** 1st Time Give Yourself Up For Someone? 2nd Time Don't Take This Job Because Something Bad Things Can Happen 3rd Time Keep Talking About What People Wanted Dogging Baby Boobs Sometimes They Just Laughed At Me Into Scolding Soapbox Calling Jackals Backwards Often We're Ignoring Everything That Actually Happens During REM Dementia!

            "dream": "Death",
            "generated": "Dream: Death\nInterpretation: To dream that you are being killed indicates your fear of death and the loss of everything. You may also be expressing some pent-up anger about something or someone in particular. Alternatively, it symbolizes a rebirth from an old situation into adulthood. It is analogous to waking life experiences where there was no hope for survival or happiness. Perhaps those who have been through this experience do not want to acknowledge their own past trauma; instead they blame themselves for what has taken place before them. Consider how much time elapsed between when these two events occur and after which both occurred.\u00a0If one person dies at home, then another will happen within ten days if only because people believe he/she did not die immediately by mistake or circumstance. If all four members of the family pass away without any children born during pregnancy, then dreaming of having five siblings means many more things than just childbearing potential. The current state of mind cannot survive alone unless confronted with new challenges like losing control of yourself. Thus dreams indicate feelings of separation or sadness as well as guilt over letting others dictate decisions regarding you. On closer examination, seeing too many dead relatives suggests lackiveness toward self-identity issues and aspects of yourself that can make matters worse. In other words , living on opposite sides of a conflict implies hostility towards certain views expressed inside. This aspect of yourself often points directly to unresolved emotions such ills as jealousy, revenge, aggression etc.. People tend ta notice minor changes occurring around them but little major change goes up until recently. Things always seem fine together again despite problemsome differences (or even seemingly insurmountable obstacles). Sometimes appearances fail to matter so long as everyone else's good fortune does justice.(see Note 8) These memories suggest strong emotional ties holding back progress especially emotionally charged situations. As seen above, dealing harshly could lead nowhere soon enough . Dreaming of dying represents physical pain rather \"pain\" itself. Your body hurts sometimes beyond repair due to stress levels caused by aging. However, healing depends upon hard work ethic, dedication & determination.

You want someone with a certain level of intellect, knowledge and/or skills who can provide valuable advice on how we need to improve in various areas (see\u00a0 The Dreaming about An Interview ). Alternatively the dreaming may be expressing fear that there is something \"wrong\" with what you have been taught at school. If it seems like things were going well until they got out of hand, then this means that everything was fine because everyone else went smoothly. In other words every decision should go according as written. Consider also if these dreams happen before work days start coming around so that people feel more confident taking care not let them down too easily!If any aspect fails, then perhaps one member of your family has experienced similar struggles but didn't get along much due their own personal flaws or differences. It suggests that others will find success through hard times even though life does seem rough sometimes. Or alternatively, seeing issues often makes sense given its significance to problems within itself. Things which occur over time tend towards positive changes occurring faster than expected.Alternatively consider waking up after having gone under water several hours ago while still feeling safe knowing no harm had ever taken place.

You feel confined and alone, yet still pursue other goals than what others may be giving you the chance to achieve. Consider also whether it refers back-to business endeavors of some sort or another. If there is something going on outside of yourself which causes problems for someone else, then perhaps this person does not like working with you enough. Alternatively, if you see an animal chasing after you across town, then do not let go until all of their energy has been directed towards achieving its goal. Perhaps they need to get rid from within themselves instead? The pursuit symbolizes courage, determination & loyalty. A more direct interpretation would read: \"I have come so far!\" This phrase indicates confidence, commitment & devotion toward helping people overcome personal obstacles. What about those who refuse to acknowledge issues surrounding sexuality ? No matter how hard things seem to please them, refusing such love will eventually leave behind lasting hurt feelings. In particular , having sex at work seems to make no sense unless everything goes according as expected . It often ends up making much worse decisions because everyone involved was too emotionally drained by these past experiences. On one hand however, sexual activity represents freedom.\u00a0Or sometimes both sexes enjoy various aspects enjoyed by different races, genders etc. However, many heterosexuals believe same sex attraction should only be found between two opposite gender partners (see 4D) especially when comparing masculine/feminine characteristics. Don't take my word for it. Do whatever it takes to meet women's standards! Dreaming of becoming pregnant implies greater awareness of fertility options before any potential childbearing opportunities open itself up to additional demands. Also consider dreams suggesting difficulties obtaining breast implants due directly to fear of pregnancy. Or dreaming of getting premenstrual syndrome means failure without success. There is always hope but little satisfaction guaranteed upon completion. REMEMBER ____________ And remember Jesus' words...

Alternatively, the loss of direction symbolizes uncertainty and lack thereof. You may be unable to move beyond some point in your waking relationship. If this sounds familiar, then it means that things could go wrong if not for an easy solution! Sometimes success depends on luck, but sometimes failure can mean even worse consequences than what was expected.\u00a0 The dreams also highlight how little control issues still present within yourself; these feelings will carry over into adulthood where they normally would never manifest itself any differently.
